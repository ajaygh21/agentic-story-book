## ⚙️ Prerequisites

To run this notebook successfully, you will need:

1.  **A Kaggle Account:** To access the native execution environment.
2.  **GitHub Linkage (Optional):** To sync notebook versions automatically.
3.  **Python Environment:** The notebook is designed for Python 3.
4.  **API Key:** An API key for your chosen Large Language Model provider (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY`). This key must be securely added as a secret in your Kaggle notebook environment.

## 🛠️ Setup and Running the Notebook

### On Kaggle (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the notebook is directly on Kaggle:

1.  Navigate to the published version of the **`agentic-story-book.ipynb`** on Kaggle.
2.  Click **"Copy and Edit"** to create your own runnable version.
3.  **Set Secrets:** Ensure you add your LLM API key as a secret (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY`) within the Kaggle notebook settings (under **"Secrets"** on the right-hand panel).
4.  Run all cells sequentially.
